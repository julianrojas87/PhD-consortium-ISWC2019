Route planning applications are often showcased as a success story for the Open Data movement.
By publishing public transport schedules as Open Data on the Web,
a wave of innovation was triggered, leading to the creation of applications used by millions.
Today the Web offers a much more diverse world of data
with virtually unlimited possibilities.
Bringing the power of the Semantic Web and Linked Data to route planning
could open the door for the next innovation wave.
Automating data integration in route planners
sets the bases for building more flexible
and personalized applications, able to consider and learn from the needs
of their users to provide more opportune and significant answers.
