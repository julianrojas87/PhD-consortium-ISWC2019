## Approach
{:#approach}

My approach consists of three steps.

1. _Semantic modeling of route planning queries_ -
A flexible semantic model to describe route planning queries
that considers different constraints
and parameters for route calculations.
By using domain vocabularies in a structured way,
automatic data requirements identification for a given query becomes possible.

2. _Hypermedia-driven Linked Data summaries_ -
Definition of general requirements to
create and publish data summaries on the Web,
based on spatial and temporal dimensions
and including declarative hypermedia controls.
By interpreting the hypermedia controls,
route planning applications are able to integrate
subsets of relevant data sources on the fly.
