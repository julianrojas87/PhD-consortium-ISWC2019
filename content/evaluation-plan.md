## Evaluation Plan
{:#evaluation-plan}

For evaluating my approach I propose the following plan:

1. _Hypothesis 1_ - An evaluation that (i) identifies available approaches in the literature
to express route planning queries and the different types of queries supported by each approach.
Then (ii) a qualitative comparison between the proposed semantic model and the literature
to verify that the proposed approach is at least as expressive as the state of the art.

2. _Hypothesis 2_ - An evaluation that measures the completeness of data discoverability
in terms of identified relevant data sources, of a route planning application
interpreting and using the proposed data summarization approach
on a closed setup that includes real-world data sources
published on the Web, for a set of queries that includes at least,
all the query types identified in the evaluation of _Hypothesis 1_.

3. _Hypothesis 3_ - A performance evaluation in terms of response time and answer completeness
will compare the proposed route planning algorithm to state of the art arbitrary multi-criteria
route planning algorithms.
