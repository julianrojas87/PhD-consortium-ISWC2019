## Evaluation Plan
{:#evaluation-plan}

For evaluating my approach I propose the following plan:

1. _Hypothesis 1_ - An evaluation that (i) identifies available approaches in the literature
to express route planning queries and the different types of queries supported by each approach.
Then (ii) a qualitative comparison between the proposed semantic model and the literature
to verify that the proposed approach is at least as expressive as the state of the art.

2. _Hypothesis 2_ - A performance evaluation in terms of response time and answer completeness
will compare different data summarization approaches through an multimodal route planning
use-case and compare its results to a centralized solution such as Open Trip Planner.
