## Research Questions
{:#research-questions}

Given the related work,
the need for a structured and declarative approach
to express route planning queries,
that allows identifying specific data requirements
to resolve them becomes apparent.
A publishing strategy of heterogeneous data on the Web,
that enables automated discovery of relevant data for route planning purposes, is also needed.
Moreover, a generic and flexible route planning algorithm,
capable of dynamically integrating multiple heterogeneous data
while remaining usable in practice, is needed.
I thus investigate the following research questions:

Research Question 1 -
: _How can route planning queries be expressed in a use-case independent and declarative way that allows identifying data requirements for resolving given queries?_

Research Question 2 -
: _How can heterogeneous data be published on the Web to enable precise automated discovery of relevant data for route planning purposes?_

Research Question 3 -
: _Which route planning algorithm is best suited to calculate route alternatives using heterogeneous data while remaining usable in practice?_
