## Research Questions
{:#research-questions}

Given the related work,
the need for a structured and declarative approach
to express route planning queries,
that allows identifying specific data requirements
to resolve them, becomes apparent.
A publishing strategy of heterogeneous data on the Web,
that allows for decentralized data access
and efficiently solving route planning queries using
state of the art algorithms is also a need.
I thus investigate the following research questions:

Research Question 1 -
: _How can route planning queries be expressed in a use-case independent and declarative way that allows identifying data requirements for resolving given queries?_

Research Question 2 -
: _How do different ways of publishing linked open data on the Web affect decentralized route planning query evaluation in terms of performance?_
