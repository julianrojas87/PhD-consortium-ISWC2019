## Research Questions
{:#research-questions}

Given the related work, is possible to highlight the need for
a publishing strategy of heterogeneous data on the Web,
that enables automated discovery of relevant data for route planning purposes.
Also, the need for a structured and declarative approach to express
route planning queries, that allows identifying specific data requirements becomes apparent.
Finally, a generic and flexible route planning algorithm,
capable of dynamically integrating multiple heterogeneous data sources
while remaining useful in practice, is needed.
I thus investigate the following research questions:

Research Question 1
: What are the minimum requirements for publishing heterogeneous data on the Web that enable automated discovery of relevant data sources for route planning purposes?

Research Question 2
: Which query language syntax is the most adequate to declaratively express route planning queries?

Research Question 3
: Route planning algorithm?
